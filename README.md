# Calculator
A simple calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The HTML structure includes a display area for the result and buttons for digits and operations. CSS is used to style the calculator, ensuring it is visually appealing and user-friendly. JavaScript handles the functionality, capturing user input, performing calculations, and updating the display dynamically.
